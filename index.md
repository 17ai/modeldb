# ModelDB: A system to manage machine learning models

Companies often build hundreds of models a day (e.g., churn, recommendation, credit default). However, there is no practical way to manage all the models that are built over time.
This lack of tooling leads to insights being lost, resources wasted on re-generating old results, and difficulty collaborating.
ModelDB is an end-to-end system that tracks models as they are built, extracts and stores relevant metadata (e.g., hyperparameters, data sources) for models, and makes this data available for easy querying and visualization.

## Why ModelDB?


## Use Cases
- Tracking Modeling Experiments
- Versioning Models
- Ensuring Reproducibility
- Visual exploration of models and results
- Collaboration

## How to use?


ModelDB clients are currently available for spark.ml and scikit-learn. See the getting started guides to use ModelDB.
