  "body": "# ModelDB: A system to manage ML models.\r\n\r\nModelDB is an end-to-end system to manage machine learning models.\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\n\r\nModelDB is made up of three main parts: the ModelDB server, the ModelDB clients, and the ModelDB frontend. \r\n\r\n### ModelDB server \r\nThe [ModelDB server](server) stores all the data for ModelDB and exposes a thrift API for storing as well as querying data.\r\n\r\n### ModelDB client\r\nModelDB clients are native libraries in various languages that can be used to log data to ModelDB. We currently provide clients for [spark.ml](client/scala/libs/spark.ml) and [scikit-learn](client/python).\r\n\r\nSample machine learning workflows using these client libraries are available [here](client/scala/libs/spark.ml/src/main/scala-2.11/edu/mit/csail/db/ml/modeldb/sample), [here](client/scala/libs/spark.ml/src/main/scala-2.11/edu/mit/csail/db/ml/modeldb/evaluation), and [here](client/python/samples).\r\n\r\n### ModelDB Frontend\r\n\r\nOnce machine learning workflows and models have been logged to ModelDB, they can be explored via the web-based ModelDB [frontend](frontend).\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nTo setup ModelDB, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. ModelDB has various dependencies. See [Required Software](docs/RequiredSoftware.md). Install the relevant ones.\r\n2. Configure and start the [server](server).\r\n3. Build modeldb clients as described in for [spark.ml](client/scala/libs/spark.ml) and [scikit-learn](client/python).\r\n4. Update your ML code to use the client libraries to log workflows and models to ModelDB, as in [here](client/scala/libs/spark.ml/src/main/scala-2.11/edu/mit/csail/db/ml/modeldb/sample), [here](client/scala/libs/spark.ml/src/main/scala-2.11/edu/mit/csail/db/ml/modeldb/evaluation), and [here](client/python/samples).\r\n5. Run your ML code normally.\r\n6. Start the ModelDB [frontend](frontend) and explore models in ModelDB.\r\n",
